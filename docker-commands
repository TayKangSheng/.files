# Docker Commands

### Removes all docker images that does not have a repository name and TAG.
## One situation that might cause this to happen is when you build an image using a 
## repositoriy name that already exist. The resulting image that is created will have 
## a <none> for both the REPOSITORY and TAG field. 
docker rmi $(docker images -f dangling=true -q)

### Remove a specific docker image. 
## Run `docker images` to list all exisiting docker on your machine.
docker rmi <IMAGE ID>

## Remove all docker processes. 
## Exiting the image does not end the docker process. Treat docker processes like 
## VMs. Stopping a VM does not equate to deleting the VM. By stopping the VM, the 
## VM merely "pauses" and you can boot up the VM again. On the otherhand, deleting
## the VM will release all resources the VM is taking up and you won't be able to 
## boot up the same VM again.
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
